# Database Read-Only Decode UI

This folder contains the removable UI pieces for the hardcoded database decode feature.

- `HardcodedDecodeToggle.tsx`: toggle shown in the Database view controls.

You can delete this folder and replace the toggle usage in `src/app/database/page.tsx` to remove the UI hook.
